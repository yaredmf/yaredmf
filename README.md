- 👋 Hi, I’m @yaredmf
- 👀 I’m interested in machine learning and I love tricky, fast algorithms.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning git commands, animations on graphs (eg. visualizing matching augmentaion, dfs/bfs in action, ...cool math visualization on networkx)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on foolwealth projects where I am still a rookie! 
- 📫 How to reach me: email is best at yared.nigussie@foolwealthcontracotrs.com
